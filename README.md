# CS50x Harvard Projects

## Introduction

Welcome to my CS50x Harvard projects repository! ðŸŽ“ I have successfully completed the CS50x course offered by Harvard University, which is an introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming.

## About CS50x

CS50x is a comprehensive course that covers various aspects of computer science, including:
- **C Programming**
- **Algorithms**
- **Data Structures**
- **Web Development**
- **Python**
- **SQL**

Throughout the course, I have worked on numerous projects and problem sets that have helped me develop a strong foundation in computer science and programming.

## Projects

Here are some of the key projects I have completed during the course:
1. **Hello, World!** - My first program in C.
2. **Caesar** - A program that encrypts messages using Caesarâ€™s cipher.
3. **Substitution** - A program that encrypts messages using a substitution cipher.
4. **Speller** - A program that checks the spelling of words in a text.
5. **Finance** - A web application for managing a virtual stock portfolio.

You can find the complete list of projects and their descriptions in the [Projects](./Projects) directory.
