Spotify has taken an average of the energy and dance ability and valence of each person's top 100 songs and created their sound aura,
 which means that if a song is in that range, that person likes it.
  I think this way is a bit good but  maybe next to this code it is better that Spotify should consider the type of MBTI of each person and singer.
    This also helps , the type of MBTI can have a relationship with the taste of the song, as well as well as the mood and emotions bcz
    someone like me dosen't like energy just my mood with mood of singer
    like NF , INTJ

    like this
    CREATE TABLE Singers (
    SingerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    MBTI VARCHAR(4)
);

CREATE TABLE Users (
    UserID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(n),
    MBTI VARCHAR(n)
);

INSERT INTO Singers (SingerID, Name, MBTI)
VALUES
    (1, 'Singer1', 'INFP'),
    (2, 'Singer2', 'INTJ'),
    (3, 'Singer3', 'ENFJ');

INSERT INTO Users (UserID, Name, MBTI)
VALUES
    (1, 'User1', 'ENFP'),
    (2, 'User2', 'INTJ'),
    (3, 'User3', 'INFP');

SELECT s.Name AS SingerName, u.Name AS UserName
FROM Singers s
JOIN Users u ON s.MBTI = u.MBTI;
